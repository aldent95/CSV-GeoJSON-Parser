# CSV-GeoJSON-Parser
Program to convert CSV data to geojson format.

This program was created as part the Summer of Tech 2015 Hackfest.
It was part of the backend for a website that displayed New Zealand crash data over time from data here: https://www.nzta.govt.nz/resources/crash-analysis-system-data/index.html

The full project could not be kept live due to it being hosted on a free but limited Heroku server.
